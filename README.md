##Description##
You are the founder of a new email service called Bobcats Send Mail Over the Internet™. You hoped to make a lot of money from this product, but no one wants to use your mailing service. After doing tons of research you found that the reason is customers prefer using a service called Vulnerable Mail Form™. Vulnerable Mail Form has a minimalistic, easy-to-understand design. You have a plan to get customers using your mail service: disable the competetor's website and embarrass them in the process.
